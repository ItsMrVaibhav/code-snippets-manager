Code Snippets Manager

Often times we face problems when we have to repeat a certain lines of code which we wrote a few days or maybe months back and now we can't find it. Well this web app helps solve that problem. Now you can store your code snippets using this web app locally, which means even if you end your session on the browser after adding your snippets and again reopen the website you'll still find your snippets there for you.

This is just a simple prototype of code snippets manager. An advanced manager with a few helpful tools is coming up soon.
